== Counter Delegation Enable (`menvcfg`.CDE)

Bit 60 of `menvcfg` (bit 28 of `menvcfgh`) is Counter Delegation Enable
(CDE). When CDE=0, the Smcdeleg and Ssccfg extensions appear to be not
implemented. When CDE=1, the behavior described in the sections below is
enabled. If Smcdeleg is not implemented, CDE is read-only zero.

== Counter Delegation

The `mcounteren` register allows M-mode to provide the next-lower
privilege mode with read access to select counters. When the Smcdeleg
extension is enabled, it further allows M-mode to delegate select
counters to S-mode.

The `siselect` (and `vsiselect`) index range 0x40-0x5F is reserved for
delegated counter access. When a counter _i_ is delegated
(`mcounteren`[_i_]=1 and `menvcfg`.CDE=1), the register state associated
with counter _i_ can be read or written via `sireg*`, while `siselect` holds
0x40+__i__. The counter state accessible via alias CSRs is shown in
Table 1 below.

[NOTE]
====
`__hpmevent__i` _represents a subset of the state accessed by the_ `__mhpmevent__i` _register. Likewise, `cyclecfg` and `instretcfg` represent a subset of the state accessed by the `mcyclecfg` and `minstretcfg` registers, respectively. See below for subset details._
====

If extension Smstateen is implemented, refer to extension
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-indirect-csr-access[[.underline]#Smcsrind/Sscsrind#]
(upon which this extension depends) for how setting bit 60 of CSR
mstateen0 to zero prevents access to registers `siselect`, `sireg*`,
`vsiselect`, and `vsireg*` from privileged modes less privileged than
M-mode, and likewise how setting bit 60 of hstateen0 to zero prevents
access to `siselect` and `sireg*` (really `vsiselect` and `vsireg*`) from
VS-mode.

The remaining rules of this section apply only when access to a CSR is
not blocked by mstateen0[60] = 0 or hstateen0[60] = 0.

While the privilege mode is M or S and `siselect` holds a value in the
range 0x40-0x5F, illegal instruction exceptions are raised for the
following cases:

* attempts to access any `sireg*` when `menvcfg`.CDE = 0;
* attempts to access `sireg3` or `sireg6`;
* attempts to access `sireg4` or `sireg5` when XLEN = 64;
* attempts to access `sireg*` when `siselect` = 0x41, or when the counter
selected by `siselect` is not delegated to S-mode (the corresponding bit
in `mcounteren` = 0).

NOTE: _The memory-mapped `mtime` register is not a performance monitoring
counter to be managed by supervisor software, hence the special
treatment of `siselect` value 0x41 described above._

For each `siselect` and `sireg*` combination defined in Table 1, the table
further indicates the extensions upon which the underlying counter state
depends. If any extension upon which the underlying state depends is not
implemented, an attempt from M or S mode to access the given state
through `sireg*` raises an illegal instruction exception.

If the hypervisor (H) extension is also implemented, then as specified
by extension Smcsrind/Sscsrind, a virtual instruction exception is
raised for attempts from VS-mode or VU-mode to directly access `vsiselect`
or `vsireg*`, or attempts from VU-mode to access `siselect` or `sireg*`. Furthermore, while `vsiselect` holds a value in the range 0x40-0x5F:

* An attempt to access any `vsireg*` from M or S mode raises an illegal
instruction exception.
* An attempt from VS-mode to access any `sireg*` (really `vsireg*`) raises
either an illegal instruction exception if `menvcfg`.CDE = 0, or a virtual
instruction exception if `menvcfg`.CDE = 1.

If Sscofpmf is implemented, `sireg2` and `sireg5` provide access only to a
subset of the event selector registers. Specifically, event selector bit
62 (MINH) is read-only 0 when accessed through `sireg*`. Similarly, if
Smcntrpmf is implemented, `sireg2` and `sireg5` provide access only to a
subset of the counter configuration registers. Counter configuration
register bit 62 (MINH) is read-only 0 when accessed through `sireg*`.

== Supervisor Counter Inhibit Register (`scountinhibit`)

Smcdeleg/Ssccfg defines a new `scountinhibit` register, a masked alias of
`mcountinhibit`. For counters delegated to S-mode, the associated
`mcountinhibit` bits can be accessed via `scountinhibit`. For counters not
delegated to S-mode, the associated bits in `scountinhibit` are read-only
zero.

When `menvcfg`.CDE=0, attempts to access `scountinhibit` raise an illegal
instruction exception. When the Supervisor Counter Delegation extension
is enabled, attempts to access `scountinhibit` from VS-mode or VU-mode
raise a virtual instruction exception.

The CSR number for `scountinhibit` is 0x120.

== Virtualizing `scountovf`

For implementations that support Smcdeleg/Ssccfg, Sscofpmf, and the H
extension, when `menvcfg`.CDE=1, attempts to access `scountovf` from VS-mode
or VU-mode raise a virtual instruction exception.

== Virtualizing Local Counter Overflow Interrupts 

For implementations that support Smcdeleg, Smcofpmf, and Smaia, the
local counter overflow interrupt (LCOFI) bit (bit 13) in each of CSRs
`mvip` and `mvien` is implemented and writable.

For implementations that support Smcdeleg/Ssccfg, Smcofpmf/Sscofpmf,
Smaia/Ssaia, and the H extension, the LCOFI bit (bit 13) in each of `hvip`
and `hvien` is implemented and writable.

[NOTE]
====
_By virtue of implementing `hvip`.LCOFI, it is implicit that the LCOFI bit
(bit 13) in each of `vsie` and `vsip` is also implemented._

_Requiring support for the LCOFI bits listed above ensures that virtual
LCOFIs can be delivered to an OS running in S-mode, and to a guest OS
running in VS-mode. The behavior of these bits is described in sections
5.3 (for `mvip` and `mvien`) and 6.3.2 (for `hvip` and `hvien`) in the
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-aia/releases/tag/1.0[[.underline]#RISC-V
Advanced Interrupt Architecture specification version 1.0#]. It is
optional whether the LCOFI bit (bit 13) in each of `mideleg` and `hideleg`,
which allows all LCOFIs to be delegated to S-mode and VS-mode,
respectively, is implemented and writable._
====

[NOTE]
====
__In a production “Rich OS” environment, it is expected that M-mode
firmware will delegate counters to supervisor by setting bits in
`mcounteren`, with `menvcfg`.CDE=1. Delegated counters should be inhibited
in M-mode by setting `mhpmevent__i__`.MINH, `mcyclecfg`.MINH, and
`minstretcfg`.MINH, while other privilege mode inhibit bits (SINH, UINH,
VSINH, VUINH) should be left cleared. It is also expected that local
counter overflow interrupts (LCOFIs) will be delegated to S-mode
(`mideleg`.LCOFIE=1), or delivered to S-mode via other means.__

_If M-mode firmware opts to reserve some counters for its own use (by
not delegating them), and intends to use them for interrupt-based
sampling, it will not delegate LCOFIs to S-mode. Instead, it will need
to leverage Smaia in order to deliver virtual LCOFIs to S-mode when an
LCOFI is the result of an overflow of a delegated counter (selective
delegation)._

* _“Bare Metal” Configuration_

_The operating system (running in S-mode) can determine which counters
have been delegated by writing all ones to `scountinhibit`, then reading
back the resulting value. It can then use `siselect` and `sireg*` to program
the delegated counters and their associated event selectors or counter
configuration registers. Unchanged is the OS’s ability to allow user
code to read select counters by setting bits in scounteren._

_Should the OS prefer to count events per context, it can swap the
counter, event selector, and counter configuration CSRs, for each
counter in use, during context switch._

_For sampling usages, the OS will initialize a counter with a large
positive value suitably close to overflow via `sireg`/`sireg4`, and clear the associated
event selector overflow (OF) bit via `sireg2`/`sireg5`. Upon counter
overflow, OF will be set and an LCOFI will be pended. The LCOFI
interrupt service routine (ISR) will be invoked in S-mode, and can
inhibit counting for all delegated counters by writing to `scountinhibit`,
then can read `scountovf` to determine which counters have overflowed. It
can then re-initialize the overflowed counter(s) and clear the OF bit, for each
overflowed counter. It may opt to snapshot all counters, or other hart
state. Finally it can resume counting, by clearing `scountinhibit`, before
resuming workload execution._

* _Hypervisor Configuration_

_A hypervisor may use the counters as described above, and can utilize
the xINH bits in the event selectors (via `sireg2`/`sireg5`) to dictate
whether the counter increments during hypervisor execution, guest
execution, or both._

_A guest OS or nested hypervisor running in VS-mode may attempt to
access performance counter resources. This extension supports a “trap
and emulate” approach to allowing guest use of counters. Guest access to
counters, event selectors, and counter configuration registers (via
`sireg*`) will result in a virtual instruction exception, which will trap
to the hypervisor. The hypervisor can then emulate the access, which may
involve utilizing a different physical counter than the one selected by
the guest. Similarly, guest access to `scountinhibit` or `scountovf` will
trap to HS-mode, ensuring that the hypervisor can emulate all registers
that affect, or are affected by, counter behavior. Prior to
Smcdeleg/Ssccfg, VS-mode access to `scountovf` did not trap, which
resulted in a virtualization hole for hypervisors that virtualize
Zicntr/Zihpm resources, since it allowed a guest direct read access to
the `hpmeventX`.OF bits._

_More likely, a hypervisor will not indicate support for Supervisor
Counter Delegation to a guest. The hypervisor thereby requires the guest
to use the
https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-sbi-doc/blob/master/riscv-sbi.adoc#performance-monitoring-unit-extension-eid-0x504d55-pmu[[.underline]#SBI
PMU interface#]. Because the SBI allows multiple CSRs to be written per
call, this approach should reduce the number of traps to HS-mode, and
thus reduce the virtualization overhead associated with Zicntr and Zihpm
use. Virtualization overhead can be further reduced when counters are
delegated to HS-mode, which allows hypervisors to directly access
delegated counters on guest SBI calls, rather than requiring a nested
SBI call from HS-mode to M-mode._

_When a guest counter overflows and pends an LCOFI, the hypervisor has
two options for delivering that interrupt to the guest:_


. _LCOFIs can be selectively delegated to the guest by the hypervisor.
If `hideleg`.LCOFI=0, an unmasked LCOFI will trap to HS-mode, where the
hypervisor can determine whether it should be handled by the guest. The
hypervisor can set `hvien`.LCOFI=hvip.LCOFI=1 in order to deliver a
virtual LCOFI to VS-mode._
. _LCOFIs can be wholly delegated to the guest by the hypervisor. By
setting `hideleg`.LCOFI=1, an unmasked LCOFI will trap to VS-mode._

_In either case, when the LCOFI or virtual LCOFI traps to VS-mode, the
handler will acknowledge the interrupt by clearing `sip`.LCOFI (really
`vsip`.LCOFI)._
